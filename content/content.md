## Audio Examples

In the following, exemplary audio samples of analyzed and synthesized noise signals are presented. The audio samples include different types of noise which were considered in the associated paper. In the synthesis, a reduced parameter set was used as proposed in the paper.

## Listening Test Signals

Those are taken from the listening test in which subjects were asked to rate the *naturalness* of the presented noise signals.
